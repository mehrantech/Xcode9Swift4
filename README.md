Problem #1:
Exercise: 501

You may know the popular darts game called 501. Players start with a score of 501, and have to work down to zero. Here are the rules:

Each player plays a “round” where they throw three darts at a board.
Each throw can score between 1 and 20 points, which may be doubled or tripled depending where it hits on the board.
It is also possible to score 25 for the outer bulls-eye or 50 for the inner bulls-eye.

House rule: At the end of three rounds, whoever is closest to zero without going below zero is the winner.
